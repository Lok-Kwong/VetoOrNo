# VetoOrNo
Just me yapping about an idea for a website that allows people to vote if a fantasy basketball trade is vetoable or not. This came about after accusations of collusion in a groupchat I am in, so I had the bright idea of allowing random people on the internet vote on our trades. Surely nothing goes wrong right? 


MVP:
1. Allow people to post their trades of players, upvote and downvote the trade
2. Feed of trades
3. Need a captcha for bots? (Maybe later)
4. Comments

What is the architecture?
Frontend - TS/JS with what framework (prob doesn't matter)
Backend - C# ???
DB - NoSQL probably?


Instructions to run frontend:
Need to install Node.js and put the environment variable into your PC
npm install
npm run dev
